      <h3> Cuts of Meat </h3>
      <p> 1. The chuck, also known as the seven-bone steak (in reference to the shape of the bone), is located near the shoulder
      and neck area of the cow <br> 2. The round, also known as the rump, is a lean cut of meat with very little fat. It is located at the
      back of the cow near the rear leg. Like the Shank, the round is a tough cut due to the constant use of the cowâ€™s legs. <br> 3. Brisket is cut from the
      breast or the lower portion of the cow. Like the shank, it has a lot of connective tissue and can be quite tough unless cooked properly. <br>
      4. The rib includes some of the finest cuts of the cow, and is the known for its juiciness, tenderness, superb marbling, and flavour. The rib cut refers to 
      ribs 6 through 12 on the cow. <br> 5. The flank is a long flat cut from the abdominal muscles of the cow. It is one of the toughest cuts of meat. <br>
      6. The loin is cut from the back of the cow, typically a portion of the hindquarter directly behind the ribs. It is one of the most tender and desirable
      cuts of beef. <br> 7. Sirloin is also cut from the back of the cow, just past the loin (a.k.a the short loin). Although, not as tender as the loin cuts, 
      the sirloin is still a very popular tender cut of beef. <br> 8. The shank is the leg of the cow and is one of the toughest meats. This is due to the fact 
      that the leg muscle is constantly used, creating a tough, sinewy cut. Therefore, it is one of the less popular, but also one of the cheapest. </p>
